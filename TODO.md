# TODO

- [x] actually there are 3 lists of goals
  - active goals
  - delayed goals
    - define predicate for what counts as a goal to delay
  - failed goals (didn't unify with any rule conclusions)
  - [ ] write test that demonstrates how goals are delayed
- [ ] data structures for "unification factoring"
  - storing an indexing data structure for efficiently unifying with a set of terms
- [ ] demonstrate delay then active
- [ ] demo finding multiple solutions
